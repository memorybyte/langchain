# Output Parsers:
    - Output parsers in LangChain help to convert raw LLM responses into structured formats like JSON, CSV, Pydantic models and more.
    - They ensure consistency, validation and ease of use in applications.
    - Output Parsers can work with 

    - stroutput parser
    - jsonoutput parser
    - structure output parser
    - pydantic output parser

# StrOutputParser:
    - It is the simplest output parser in LangChain.
    - It is used to parse the output of a Language Model (LLM) and return it as a plain string. 

# JsonOutputParser:


# StructuredOutputParser:
    - It is an output parser in LangChain that helps extract structured JSON data from LLM responses based on predefined field schemas.
    - It works by defining a list of fields (ResponseSchema) that the model should return, ensuring the output follows a structured format.
    - But we can validate the schema.
