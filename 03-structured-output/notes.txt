        - It is a way to define a dictionary in Python where you specify what keys and values should exist.
        - It helps ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structure.

        @ Why use TypedDict ?
            - It tells Python what keys are required and what types of values they should have.
            - It does not validate data at runtime. It just helps with type hints for better coding.

    # Pydantic:
