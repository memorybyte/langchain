# The model component in LangChain is crucial part of the framework, designed to facilitate interactions with various language models and embedding models.

# It abstracts the complexity of working directly with different LLMs, chat models, and embedding models, providing a uniform interface to communicate with them.

# This makes it easier to build applications that rely on AI generated text, text embeddings for similarity search, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

# Language Models:
    - Language models are AI systems designed to process, generate and understand natural language text.

    1. LLMs:
        - General purpose models that is used for raw text generation.
        - They take a string (or plain text) as input and returns a string (plain text).
        - These are traditionally older models and are not used much now.
        - Memory and Context: No built-in Memory
        - Role and awareness: No understanding of 'user' and 'assistant' roles
        - Use cases: Text Generation, Summarization, Translation, Creative writing, Code generation

    2. Chat Models:
        - Language models that are specialized for conversational tasks.
        - They take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text). 
        - These are traditionally newer models and used more in comparison to the LLMs.
        - Memory and Context: Supports structured conversation history
        - Role and awareness: Understands 'system', 'user' and 'assistant' roles
        - Use cases: Conversational AI, chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support, AI tutors
